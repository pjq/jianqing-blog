After upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04 recently, the DigitalOcean nameserver doesn't work after reboot, so need to manual update the /etc/resolv.conf.

You can then create or modify a file `/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail`

```
`cat /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail
nameserver 8.8.8.8`
```

After reboot, your nameserver will be worked well

```
`cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
# 127.0.0.53 is the systemd-resolved stub resolver.
# run "systemd-resolve --status" to see details about the actual nameservers.

nameserver 127.0.0.53
search DOMAINS
