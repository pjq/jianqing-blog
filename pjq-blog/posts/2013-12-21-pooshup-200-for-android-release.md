Pooshup 2.0.0 for Android Release

**Cheers**

I have just uploaded  the [Pooshup 2.0.0 to Google Play.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.pjq.pushups)

Because it  looks not so perfect, so if you have any suggestion, please DO NOT hesitate to contact me.

**[(The iOS version already released in Apple App Store, you can download it from here.)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pushup!/id750845921?mt=8)**

**So what's Pooshup?**

To be brief, it is a simple application used to do pushups. It use the mobile phone's proximity sensor to detect the pushups.

**Why develop it?**

No complicate reason, just for fun, for the lazy guys. It is just a simple idea, and we make it to happen. To have a health life, help people to do some simple exercise, at office or at home or any place if you want, just do it.

**What we get?**

It won

	-  the AngelHack Shanghai 2013

	-  the StartupWeekend Shanghai 2013

	-  the hottest booth of TechCrunch Shanghai 2013

So it is really amazing and funny, how do  you think about it?

**So Next...**

We are joining the Global [HACKcelerator](http://angelhack.com/hackcelerator%E2%80%8E) event, and don't know how far we can reach. Maybe we can have the chance to the Silicon Valley, who knows.

**Our Pooshup Story**

I have written a [presentation](http://pushup.pjq.me/pushup/deckjs_pushup/pooshup/) to share our pooshup story.
