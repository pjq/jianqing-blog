Today we have a team building, it is my first time of skating on the real ice.  It is really exciting and funny, also dangerous. And I think  I need more time to practice and learn the skating tricks(Maybe we can go by ourself.). Thank you everyone.

I have uploaded some awesome pictures to Google+(Actually it is auto backuped by the Google+ App.),  and create a new album, you can click the following link to get it.
