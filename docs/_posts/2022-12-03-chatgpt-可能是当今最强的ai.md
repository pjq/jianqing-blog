今天玩了一下ChatGPT, 发现这东西太强了，简单列举一下看到的一些功能

- 支持中文

- 可以写代码

- 可以写架构设计

- 可以根据简短的描述，写一篇完整的文档

- 可以找到代码中的bug

- 可以写诗

- 可以把代码转成其他语言实现

- 可以教你学习新的语言

- 可以解LeetCode 

- 可以解释正则表达式的意义

- 甚至可以重新设计git 

- 可以写好高大上的Vision, Strategy 文档

- 可以写产品设计文档

- 功能太多了

举一个例子，输入如下

> 

Regarding the Mobile Testing, it will include Performance Testing, Unit Test, Component Test, as well as Automation Testing, we have Android and iOS, and it will have several different tech stacks and tools

For the Automation testing, we have UiAutomator for Android, EarlyGrey for iOS, and also Accessibility Testing should be included

For the Tech stacks, we have Java/Kotlin for Android, Object C/Swift for iOS

For the Dashboard or visualization, we'll use Grafana, Splunk.

Also we will follow the testing Methodology pyramid

So based on this information, draft the Mobile Testing Vision, Goals, Objectives, Tools, Strategy, Solutions, Testing Methodology pyramid and all the related things together.

以下为ChatGPT 输出

Mobile Testing Vision:

The vision for our mobile testing is to ensure the highest quality and performance for our Android and iOS applications. We will use a combination of manual and automation testing to thoroughly test each aspect of the apps, including their functionality, usability, and accessibility. We will also use a variety of tools and tech stacks to support our testing efforts.

Goals:

- Ensure that our Android and iOS applications are reliable, user-friendly, and accessible to all users

- Identify and fix any bugs or issues with the apps before they are released to the public

- Continuously monitor and improve the performance of the apps

- Stay up-to-date with the latest mobile testing best practices and tools

Objectives:

- Develop and implement a comprehensive mobile testing plan

- Select and configure the appropriate tools and tech stacks for the testing process

- Conduct unit, component, and automation testing for both Android and iOS apps

- Use dashboards and visualization tools (such as Grafana and Splunk) to monitor and analyze testing results

- Collaborate with development teams to resolve any issues identified during testing

- Regularly review and update the mobile testing plan to ensure its effectiveness

Tools:

- UiAutomator (for Android)

- EarlyGrey (for iOS)

- Accessibility testing tools

- Java/Kotlin (for Android)

- Object C/Swift (for iOS)

- Grafana, Splunk (for dashboards and visualization)

Strategy:

Our mobile testing strategy will involve a combination of manual and automation testing, with a focus on ensuring the reliability, usability, and accessibility of our Android and iOS apps. We will use a testing pyramid approach, with a greater emphasis on unit and component testing at the lower levels of the pyramid and more automation testing at the higher levels. We will also use a variety of tools and tech stacks to support our testing efforts.

Solutions:

- Develop a comprehensive mobile testing plan that covers all aspects of the apps, including their functionality, usability, and accessibility

- Select and configure the appropriate tools and tech stacks for the testing process

- Conduct unit, component, and automation testing for both Android and iOS apps

- Use dashboards and visualization tools to monitor and analyze testing results

- Collaborate with development teams to resolve any issues identified during testing

Testing Methodology pyramid:

Our testing methodology pyramid will follow the standard approach, with unit testing at the base, followed by component testing, integration testing, and system testing at the higher levels. Automation testing will be used throughout the pyramid, with a greater emphasis on the higher levels. The goal of this approach is to provide a solid foundation of testing at the lower levels, while also ensuring that the overall system is thoroughly tested before it is released to the public.

To ensure the success of our mobile testing efforts, we will follow a systematic and organized approach. This will involve the following steps:

- Develop a comprehensive mobile testing plan that outlines the specific goals, objectives, and strategies for our testing efforts. This plan should be developed in collaboration with the development team and other stakeholders to ensure that it aligns with the overall goals of the project.

- Select and configure the appropriate tools and tech stacks for the testing process. This will involve choosing the right tools and languages for each specific platform (Android and iOS) and ensuring that they are properly configured and integrated with our testing workflow.

- Conduct unit, component, and automation testing for both Android and iOS apps. This will involve using a combination of manual and automated testing techniques to thoroughly test each aspect of the apps.

- Use dashboards and visualization tools to monitor and analyze testing results. This will involve setting up and configuring tools like Grafana and Splunk to provide real-time visibility into the testing process and to help identify any issues or trends that may need to be addressed.

- Collaborate with development teams to resolve any issues identified during testing. This will involve working closely with the development team to quickly identify and fix any bugs or other issues that are discovered during testing.

Throughout this process, we will also regularly review and update the mobile testing plan to ensure its effectiveness and to make any necessary changes or adjustments. By following this systematic approach, we can ensure that our mobile testing efforts are successful and that our Android and iOS apps are of the highest quality.
